# üìß Email Setup Guide for Billing System

## Overview
The billing system now supports sending professional bills directly to dealer email addresses. This guide will help you set up email functionality.

## üîß Setup Steps

### 1. **Gmail Setup (Recommended for Development)**

1. Go to Google Account Settings > Security
2. Turn on "Less secure app access" (Note: This is being phased out)

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```
